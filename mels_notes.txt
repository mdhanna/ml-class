Recommended GRU over LSTM because faster to train and run
Keras uses hard sigmoid by default
use CuDNNGRU instead of GRU to import from Keras, way faster
If feeding one LSTM to another, need to turn return_state to True so you can feed that state to the other
Bidirectional can help with sentient analysis because end of sentence is also important (bidirectional concatenates the vector output from both directions and dense layer run on that concatentation)
